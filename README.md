# Project-Manhattan


# Introduction

A Windows Console Application that gives a list of recommended events based on the proximity from the user's location and the ticket prices of the events. The application was developed using C# using the IDE Visual Studio Professional 2017. The application also contains validation checks for the user's input and also contains exception handlers thereby preventing unexpected crashes during the usage of the application.


# Executing Project Manhattan  
The application could be used by either from the executable file found in the path "\Project Manhattan\Project Manhattan\bin\Debug" or by using Visual Studio. 

On choosing to use Visual Studio, the .sln file could be found the path : \Project Manhattan\ Project Manhattan.sln.

# Assumptions Made
The application is developed with the following assumptions 
* The program operates in a world that ranges from -10 to +10 (Y axis), and -10 to +10 (X axis).
* The user always wants to see the events that are at a closer distance from his location.
* The user always prefers the lowest price of the tickets for the events that are found at a shorter proximity from his/her current location.
